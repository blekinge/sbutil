2009-02-18: SB Util 0.4.0
=========================

 * Introduce a new 'reader' package with a set of handy Readers

   - CharSequenceReader a reader that can read from anything implementing the
     CharSequence interface. This includes important classes such as
     StringBuilder and StringBuffer, not to mention SB Util's own
     CircularCharBuffer

   - ReplaceReaders a new abstract class for readers that substitute substrings
     on the fly while reading. There is included a factory for selecting an
     appropriate optimized impl. class among one of

       o CharReplacer
       o CharArrayReplacer
       o StringReplacer

 * Add CircularCharBuffer which is a memory efficient way of buffering
   character data in a queue/reader like manner

 * Add TextTransformer interface (implemented by ReplaceReaders)

 * Add a StaticConnectionFactory for the rpc package. It is used to do
   "local rpc" ie. the connection factory simply returns a given Java object,
   effectively dispatching method calls to a local object

 * Introduce a new collection of XML utilities in the 'xml' package. The intent
   of this new package is not to provide hardcore XML handling capabilities,
   but providing a set of *thread safe* convenience functions that provide
   good performance by using caching tricks and what not:

   - DOM, a collection of DOM manipulation utilities, also with an XPath
     selection API

   - XMLUtil with a method for xml-escaping a string, and probably more to
     come in later versions of sbutil

   - XSLT with methods for easy XSLT processing
