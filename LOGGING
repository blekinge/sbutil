LOGGING CONVENTIONS IN THE SBUTIL MODULE

For each class definition, declare and initialize 
a log attribute as follows:
      
      
      import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
      import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory; 
      
      public class CLASS
      {
          private Log log = LogFactory.getLog(CLASS.class);
          ...
      ...          

              
NO STATIC LOGGERS 
from http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/guide.html:

For application code, declaring the log member
as "static" is more efficient as one Log object is created 
per class, and is recommended. However this is not safe to 
do for a class which may be deployed via a "shared" classloader
in a servlet or j2ee container or similar environment. 

If the class may end up invoked with different thread-context-classloader
values set then the member must not be declared static. 
The use of "static" should therefore be avoided in code within any 
"library" type project.
